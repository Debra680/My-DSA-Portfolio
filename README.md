###  Introduction.
###### This portfolio showcases my journey through a data analysis class, with Digital Skillup Africa for the period of 3 to 4months.
###### Where I gained foundational knowledge and practical skills in data analysis using Microsoft Excel, SQL Server (Structured Query Language) and Power Bi.

####  Key Takeaways.

###### 1. Foundation of Data: I learned the basics of data analysis, including data types, data visualization, and data storytelling.
###### 2. Introduction to Microsoft Excel: I became familiar with Excel's interface, formulas, and functions, enabling me to efficiently manage and analyze data.
###### 3. Basic Functions in Excel: I mastered essential Excel functions, such as:
######      -  Data manipulation (filtering, sorting, grouping)
######      -  Formula writing (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc.)
######      -  Data visualization (charts, tables, pivot tables)
###### 4. Report: I applied my knowledge to create a comprehensive report, demonstrating my ability to collect, analyze, and present data insights.

####  Skills Acquired;

######  ✓Data analysis and visualization
######  ✓Excel proficiency (formulas, functions, pivot tables)
######  ✓Data storytelling and reporting
######  ✓Critical thinking and problem-solving


##   SQL and Data Systems.

###  Explored various SQL systems:
####    - PostgreSQL
####    - MySQL
####    - Oracle DB
####    - SQL Server
####    - Google BigQuery
####    - SQLite
##### I Understood that these systems share the same structured query language (SQL) but differ in their operating systems and specific features.


Data Types.

✓There are three types of data:
    1. Structured data: Organized and formatted data (e.g., tables, databases)

    2. Semi-structured data: Data with some level of organization but needs to be cleaned out before analysing.(e.g., XML, JSON)

    3. Unstructured data: Unorganized data (e.g., text, images, videos)

Data Roles.

✓Differentiated between various data roles:
    1. Data Scientist: Analyzes complex data to gain insights and make predictions
    2. Data Analyst: Interprets and analyzes data to inform business decisions
    3. Data Engineer: Designs, builds, and maintains large-scale data systems
    4. Data Administrator: manages and maintains databases
    5. Business Intelligence Developer: develops data visualization and reporting tools
    6. Analytics Engineer: Builds and maintains data pipelines and architectures

SQL Fundamentals.

Learned about;

    ✓SQL Basics: Data types, queries, and commands

    ✓Database concepts: Advantages, data storage, and retrieval

    ✓SQL command types:
        - DDL (Data Definition Language)
        - DML (Data Manipulation Language)
        - DCL (Data Control Language)
        - TCL (Transaction Control Language)
        - DQL (Data Query Language)

 SQL Keys.

✓Understood various SQL keys:
    1. Super key: A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.

    2. Candidate key: A minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.

    3. Composite key: A combination of two or more attributes that uniquely identifies a row.

    4. Primary key: A unique identifier for each row.

    5. Alternate key: A candidate key that is not the primary key.

    6. Surrogate key: An artificial key used as a primary key.

    7. Foreign key: A field that references the primary key of another table

SQL Queries and Functions.

Learned about:
    ✓SQL query basics: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses
    ✓SQL joins: INNER, RIGHT, LEFT, and FULL joins
    ✓SQL aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, and MIN
    ✓SQL set operations: UNION, UNION ALL, and INTERSECT
    ✓SQL Views and CASE statement.
